Welcome back, little creature!

While you were away, I have been searching through my database to learn more about your unique outfit,<LINE>and since you are already here - would you like to hear about it?

First, do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually, you are talking to one right now, and you are<LINE>likely a descendant of one of them as well!

Your ancestors were likely created with the sole purpose of cleaning the insides of pipes, although that<LINE>was not all that they were used for. Some of my citizens took a liking to them and kept them<LINE>as companions instead, giving them various outfits and titles.

It appears to me the shoes that you wear were a part of such apparel, and are actually composed of<LINE>purposed organisms themselves!

I will spare you the details, but your current apparel works on the base of magnetism, allowing for<LINE>quick travel on any smooth metal surface.

As for the glasses you wear, they were for the many of your kind who did not enjoy wearing masks but<LINE>needed ocular protection from the sun. Your style was most likely sold at clearance emporiums, but don't<LINE>worry - they suit you perfectly!~

Oh... I did not mean to speak for so long. You may leave now, although I do not mind your company. Stay<LINE>as long as you would like, little creature.
