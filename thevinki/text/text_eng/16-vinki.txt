This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt to<LINE>scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.

It's written in internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate so you would understand. It's a methodology for<LINE>global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!

"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?

I would be wary of going there, there are many dangers that come with travelling through such difficult<LINE>terrain.

Also the pearls in the waste masses inevitably attract scavengers, which can be very dangerous when provoked.

But, you seem to have made it out of there.
