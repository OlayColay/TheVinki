It seems like this genius supercomputer is unable to process what is happening to the world. How ironic.
"$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
You get the feeling that you should leave, but you cannot pick a direction since there are too many now. 
Everything around you morphs so much your brain starts to deny the surrounding reality. Or maybe it is not a reality anymore? 
As you struggle to find your place in this new world, you witness the robot begin to glow white, as light spills out, blinding you.

Close your eyes.
