Hello, little friend!

Now what have you got here…? A citizen drone?

Now that is an interesting find! It seems to have bound itself to you upon reactivation, allowing you to<LINE>use its citizen ID. I wonder why that is. Maybe it has something to do with your outfit, which made you appear<LINE>close enough to the original owner that the damaged scanner misidentified you?

I suppose having it would make you our citizen! 

It seems to be out of sync, but I might help you with it. I will input the code required to activate the<LINE>gate to my city, but if you wish to pay a visit to the top of Five Pebbles, you would need to ask him for a second code.

SPECEVENT : resync
