Hello, little friend!

Now what have you got here...? A citizen drone?

Now that is an interesting find! It seems to have bound itself to you, allowing you to use its citizen ID.<LINE>I wonder why that is. Maybe it has something to do with your outfit, which made you appear close enough to<LINE>he original owner that the scanner misidentified you?

I suppose having it would make you our citizen!

It appears to me that Five Pebbles has already resynced it to his structure, granting you access to his city.

It is only fair that I connect it with my own as well.

SPECEVENT : resync
