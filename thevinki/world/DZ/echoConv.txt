You! The rodent with its ears obstructed by seashells!

You sail through this broken land with the wind of a blazing inferno, yet I see past the blockade atop your snout.

The eyes of a moon without the light of a sun. It's unmistakable!

As perhaps the final scholar of arts, you must exclaim that beautiful feeling to this vast desert.

Pay no mind to that oversized calculator. He cannot understand the mission I've graciously revealed to you.

Let this filthy husk of a civilization be washed by the tsunami of your art. The art of despair!
