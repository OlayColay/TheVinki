“Is this supposed to be me and BSM? What is it about the way you always depict reality so warped and devoid of any sense?”
The robot doesn’t seem to understand the true worth of this painting. 
If you think about it, it is sad that the way their perception works doesn’t let them appreciate the true value of art. 
Their own decision to hate and avoid certain topics has made them lose a big portion of 
potential satisfaction they could’ve gotten if they perceived the world without the 
distorting lenses they themselves created. Otherwise their lives could’ve been much more pleasant and meaningful.

Skill issue.
