Ah... Little friend, I would appreciate it if you did not take any neurons from Five Pebbles, nor me for<LINE>that matter. I know that you might be curious or hungry, but it is not very respectful. 

They are a part of us, holding our memories and feelings, and I would not feel very good about holding<LINE>memories that belong to Pebbles within my structure without him handing them to me directly.

I would appreciate it if you brought it back to him and apologized for your behavior.
