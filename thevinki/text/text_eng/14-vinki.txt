It's an old text. The verses are familiar to me, but I don't believe you would find much use in knowing<LINE>the long-since departed author. The language is very old and intricate.

The first verse starts by drawing a comparison between the world and a tangled rug. It says that the world<LINE>is an unfortunate mess. Like a knot, the nature of its existence is the fact that the parts are locking each<LINE>other, none able to spring free.

Then as it goes on the world becomes a furry animal hide, I suppose... because now us living beings are<LINE>like insects crawling in the fur. And then it's a fishing net, because the more we struggle and squirm, the<LINE>more entangled we become.

It says that only the limp body of the jellyfish cannot be captured in the net. So we should try to be like<LINE>the jellyfish, because the jellyfish doesn't try.

This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition, yet deeply convinced that<LINE>striving in itself was an unforgivable vice. They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps<LINE>that's what we were to them, someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to.

I know I have tried very hard.
