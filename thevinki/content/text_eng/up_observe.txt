The slugcat grabs a pearl and a rock, and shoves them down his throat. 
He appears to start choking, making grotesque sounds.
Just as you're considering performing the Heimlich maneuver, he spits up a can-like object and holds it out to you. 
It's dripping with saliva.
"Yo, homie! I'm eager to peep your artistic skills, so I'll let you drop a bomb work of art first! Go for it!"
You have no problem with grabbing the slobbery can. It's time to impress him with your artistry! 
What will you depict?
